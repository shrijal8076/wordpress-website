# wordpress-website
here I go  to make some website on wordpress using some plugin ,elementor and html,css and javascript.
and i also use Profreehost website for free host and domain, so that i can easily practice on some other website.
It is very helpful website for students and people who want to learn though live website but do not want to invest for little projects.
but disadvantage of this website is that some times it throw some unnecessary error like database connection error,
please update plan etc but it can be sought out through refresh 2 or 3 times.
